# Lung Cancer Detection

This repo contains implementations of various neural networks that attempt to segment lung nodules on the [LIDC-IDRI](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1966254) database. This work is being done as part of our class project for the Spring 2023 offering of CSE493G1: Deep Learning.
